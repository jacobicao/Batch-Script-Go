Small tools useful when I working on windows. Hope to help you.
## friday_report.bat
This batch script will creat a file named by the date of coming friday, 
and pop up a message to tell you let's write the weekly report.
It can be double click to run, whenever you wish to write weekly report.
In fact, usually, it is set into the task scheduler to run every friday afternoon automaticly.
